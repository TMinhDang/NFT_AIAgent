NFT MARKETPLACE

The blockchain project uses the Clarity language on the Stacks blockchain, with the following components:

Agent 1 - Image Creation: A smart contract responsible for generating or storing information about an image (e.g., URL or hash on IPFS).

Agent 2 - Image Evaluation: A smart contract that evaluates the monetary value of the image (simulated or based on specific logic, e.g., 100-500 USD/STX).

User Mechanism:

Users input the amount they are willing to pay to "purchase" the image.

The system compares the user’s input amount with the image’s value determined by Agent 2:

If the amount < image value → Increase the counter (count up).
If the amount ≥ image value → Decrease the counter (count down).
Objective: Build a blockchain-based system to manage image creation, value evaluation, and user interaction with a counting mechanism that increases or decreases based on the bid amount.
